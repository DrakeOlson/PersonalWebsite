## Prior to My Current Career

First off, let us start with my name. I am Drake! No no, not the music artist, but a normal guy from the midwest that has a college degree in computer science that gave me the basic framework that I use everyday.

Before college, I worked at a local grocery chain starting off stocking shelves working in various departments. This was a normal thing to do still at that age in my hometown. Also, my hometown isn't like most hometowns. We are not the small towns people think of with less than a hundred or even five hundred people. My hometown is classified as a city, but it does not feel like that. I can drive from one end of the city to the other in fifteen-ish minutes.

## My Current Career
How I got into the world I am in now, is by filling in the spots the company I work at now. Someone left that was our imaging and Configuration Manager go to. I was put through a crash coarse on both of them for two weeks before he left. One thing lead to another and now, I am learning all sorts of things with Intune, Microsoft 365, and Azure. 

Now, I am not a person that knows everything. I still ask silly questions every day just to confirm my brain is working. I do not think that everyone can know everything. They may know the topic, but to form an answer, a Google search or documentation reading is needed. I still have to do this with the most silliest things, one of them being how to run PowerShell scripts from a batch script.
